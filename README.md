This is a simple breakout board for the Cree CLMWB RGB LED. Onboard resistors are provided to create
approximately equal visible brightness for each channel, with additional jumpers to bypass the resistors
for other current control methods. The simple solder pads are intended to interface directly with bare or
tinned wires.
